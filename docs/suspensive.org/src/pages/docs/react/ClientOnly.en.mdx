# ClientOnly

### props.fallback

This component renders children only in the client environment and renders the fallback on the server. You can set an appropriate fallback to enhance the user experience as needed.

```tsx /fallback/
import { ClientOnly } from './ClientOnly'

const Example = () => (
  <ClientOnly fallback={<>Loading...</>}>
    <div>This will only be rendered on the client side</div>
  </ClientOnly>
)
```
